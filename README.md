# LibMultiLabel — a Library for Multi-label Text Classification

LibMultiLabel is a simple tool with the following functionalities.

- end-to-end services from raw texts to final evaluation/analysis
- support for common neural network architectures and linear classsifiers
- easy hyper-parameter selection

This is an on-going development so many improvements are still being made. Comments are very welcome.
