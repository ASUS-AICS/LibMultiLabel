# LibMultiLabel â€” a Library for Multi-label Text Classification

LibMultiLabel is a simple tool with the following functionalities.

- end-to-end services from raw texts to final evaluation/analysis
- support for common neural network architectures and linear classsifiers
- easy hyper-parameter selection

This is an on-going development so many improvements are still being made. Comments are very welcome.

## Environments
- Python: 3.7+
- CUDA: 10.2 (if training neural networks by GPU)
- Pytorch 1.8+

If you have a different version of CUDA, go to the [website](https://pytorch.org/) for the detail of PyTorch installation.
