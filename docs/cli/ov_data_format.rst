Installation and Dataset Formats
=============================================

To work with the command line interface, firstly

    - :ref:`installation`

The supported :ref:`data_format` include:

    - :ref:`libmultilabel-format`
    - :ref:`libsvm-format`

Then the following modules are available.

    - `Training and Prediction for Linear Classifiers <linear.html>`_
    - `Training, Prediction, and Hyperparameter Search for Neural Networks <nn.html>`_

-------------------------------------------

.. _installation:

Install LibMultiLabel from Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Environment

    * Python: 3.7+
    * CUDA: 11.6 (if training neural networks by GPU)
    * Pytorch 1.13.1+

It is optional but highly recommended to
create a virtual environment.
For example, you can first refer to the
`link <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
for the installation guidances of Miniconda
and then create a virtual enviroment as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n LibMultiLabel python=3.7
    conda activate LibMultiLabel

* Clone `LibMultiLabel <https://github.com/ASUS-AICS/LibMultiLabel>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ASUS-AICS/LibMultiLabel.git
    cd LibMultiLabel

* Install the latest development version, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install .[all]

If you have a different version of CUDA,
follow the installation instructions for PyTorch LTS at
their `website <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

.. _data_format:

Dataset Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input data for building train, test, and validation datasets must have specific formats.
For neural networks, the only accepted format is the
:ref:`libmultilabel-format`. For linear methods,
both :ref:`libmultilabel-format` and
:ref:`libsvm-format` are accepted.
More sample sets in these formats can be downloaded from the
`LIBSVM data <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html>`_.

.. _libmultilabel-format:

LibMultiLabel Format
--------------------

The LibMultiLabel format is a format for IDs (optional), labels, and raw texts.
They are combined in a single file, using tabs and line endings as control characters.
It must satisfy the following requirements

- one sample per line
- ID, labels, and texts are separated by ``<TAB>`` (the ID column is optional)
- labels are split by spaces
- each field should not contain any ``<TAB>``

An example with the ID column::

    2286<TAB>E11 ECAT M11 M12 MCAT<TAB>recov recov recov recov excit ...
    2287<TAB>C24 CCAT<TAB>uruguay uruguay compan compan compan ...

An example without the ID column::

    E11 ECAT M11 M12 MCAT<TAB>recov recov recov recov excit ...
    C24 CCAT<TAB>uruguay uruguay compan compan compan ...

.. _libsvm-format:

LibSVM Format
-------------

The LibSVM format is a format for labels and sparse numerical
features. They are combined in a single file,
using commas, spaces, colons and line endings as control characters.
It must meet the criteria below

- one sample per line
- labels and features are separated by a space
- labels are split by commas
- features are split by spaces
- each feature is specified as ``index:value``, with index starting from ``1``

Some sample lines are as follows::

    1,3,5 1:0.1 9:0.2 13:0.3
    2,4,6 2:0.4 10:0.5 14:0.4
